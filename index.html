    <h2>Ladder Description</h2>

    <p>
    Welcome to the ladder! The ladder is a game where anyone can join
    by providing an email address and a password. Each participant has
    a unique rank, representing her or his standing in the game relative
    to the other players. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The goal of the game is to maintain as high of a position on the
    ladder as you can, where having rank 1 means being at the top of
    the ladder. You can challenge other players who are within three positions
    above you on the ladder to attempt to beat one of them in a head-to-head
    competition, and a recipient must accept your challenge before you can
    compete. Only players who are not already participating in an accepted
    challenge are available for being challenged. The winner of the match is 
    whoever wins the best three out of five games. If you manage to win
    a match against a higher-ranked player, you will move up on the ladder,
    increasing in rank.
