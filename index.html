    <h2>Ladder Description</h2>

    <p>
    Welcome to Jordan's ladder! The ladder is an online ranking system for the
    game of racquetball, where anyone can join by providing a username, email 
    address, and password. Each participant has a unique rank, representing her 
    or his overall standing in the game relative to the other players. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Having rank 1 means being at the top of
    the ladder. You can challenge other players who are within three positions
    above you on the ladder to attempt to beat one of them in a head-to-head
    competition, and a recipient must accept your challenge before you can
    compete. Only players who are not already participating in an accepted
    challenge are available for being challenged. The winner of the match is 
    whoever wins the best three out of five games. If you manage to win
    a match against a higher-ranked player, you will move up on the ladder,
    increasing in rank.
